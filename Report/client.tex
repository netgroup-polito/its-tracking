\chapter{Client}\label{Chap:Client}
The client is a web application developed in Angular. It is designed to choose and simulate the vehicle journey inside a given map.

\section{Client architecture}
The client is composed by two pages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Home page: where it is possible to choose the path
	\item Route page: where it is possible to see the route and the next directions to take.
\end{itemize}
The application uses a service to make HTTP requests to the server to retrieve the information needed and another one to share data inside the client.

\section{Home page}
In the home page it is possible to decide the origin and destination of the vehicle, in order to retrieve an authorization from the server and a path that should be followed.
