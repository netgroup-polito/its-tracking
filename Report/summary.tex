\chapter{Summary}\label{Chap:Summary}
The aim of this project has been the one to design a \textbf{RESTful web service} able to \underline{track} the precence of vehicles in a area with \textbf{restricted access} and, based on this information, choose if \underline{guarantee or reject} the access to other vehicles. If the \textit{access is granted}, the system, has to provide the client application, of the newly-entered vehicle, with a \textit{suggested path to follow}. Otherwise, the vehicle is just \textit{rejected by the system} with a message.\\
In order to be able to \textbf{track} the vehicle, the client application has to sent \underline{periodically} (every time a new place is entered) information about the current position. At any point in time, the vehicle can decide \underline{not to follow} the suggested path, in this case the system has to be able to provide the client with a \textit{new route, if possible}.\\
