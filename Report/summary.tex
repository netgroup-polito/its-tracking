The aim of this project has been the one to design a RESTful web service able to track the precence of vehicles in a area with restricted access and, based on this information, choose if guarantee or reject the access to other vehicles. If the access is granted, the system has to provide the newly-entered vehicle with a suggested path to follow. Otherwise, the vehicle is just rejected by the system with a message.\\
In order to be able to track the vehicle, the client application has to periodically send information about the current position. At any point in time, the vehicle can decide not to follow the suggested path, in this case the system has to be able to provide the client with a new route, if possible.\\
